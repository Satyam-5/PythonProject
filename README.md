# PythonProject
## Explore US Bikeshare Data
This Python script is written for Project 1 of Udacity's Python Foundation Nanodegree and is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

## How to run the script

You can run the script using a Jupyter Notebook. To install Jupyter Notebook on your system, you will need to download the Anaconda installer. This script is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer. After downloading and installing Anaconda, you will find the Jupyter Notebook by opening Anaconda Navigator.

## Data Source
In the data folder there are 6 files representing the original data file and the wrangled data file for each city analyzed.

## Dataset
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for three major cities of United States ( Chicago, New York City, and Washington).

The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:

* Start Time
* End Time
* Trip Duration (in seconds)
* Start Station
* End Station
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also contain the following two columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year
